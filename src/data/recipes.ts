            "Regal Biscuits are a secret family recipe created by my late grandfather Warrick - a brilliant, wonderful, saint of a man. They are his masterpiece and were the signature dessert of the Royal Kitchen eatery. I bake them often to remind me of my dear grandfather, and even now, more than a decade after his passing, I find their scent still causes my eyes to grow a bit misty from time to time."
